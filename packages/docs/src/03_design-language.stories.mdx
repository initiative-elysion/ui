The challenges we face as a society require leadership. Once we identify a problem, we act. We embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.

## Brand

Brand drives every single decision you make when building new products or features. A good brand is much more than a name and a logo. It’s the values that define your unique identity and what makes you stand out from others.

### Vision

Why you exist, what your values are and how they’ll help guide the future of your product.

### Design principles

The considerations that guide the basis of your practice. They outline how you approach design from a philosophical perspective and help with everyday decisions.

### Tone of voice

A clear tone of voice defines how you speak to your audience at every moment in their journey, helping them get wherever they want to go.

### Terminology

Create the standard terms and phrases that need to be kept the same throughout the user experience, speeding up the design process and unifying your voice.

### Writing guidelines

Every consistent experience needs watertight writing. Laying down the foundations for your house style early keeps everything in line with consistent grammar, style choices and action-oriented language to help your design.

## Logo

Most customers form an opinion about a product in seconds. In most cases, your logo will be the first brand asset someone sees. It’s all about making the right first impression. A distinctive logo helps users recognise a product immediately and gives them the essence of your branding.

### Monochrome version

A monochrome version of your logo that looks good on top of photography or when it’s printed with a poor quality printer.

### Small use guidance

Your logo must perform well and be recognisable at all sizes. Tips for using your logo in these cases will minimise the risk of it being misused.

### Placement and clearance guidance

Your logo must come with clear guidance on how to place it and how to preserve its space since it lives along with other content.

### Usage guidance

These are the logo crimes, providing contextual examples of what to (not) do with your logo.

### Different file formats

Providing a variety of formats for the vector version of your logo will make it easier for others to work and prevent anyone from redrawing it.

## Guidelines

Providing guidance on how to approach common UX patterns will allow your organisation to establish a consistent approach and a consistent user experience on any platform.

### Accessibility

Guidelines for how you approach accessibility and how you leverage colour, hierarchy and assistive technologies to help your users.

### User onboarding

How you onboard your users to your product or a new feature and give them a great experience from the start.

### Notifications and permissions

Guardrails for how to write for the components that make up your designs, from style and technical rules to channeling your tone of voice correctly through copy.

### Microcopy guidelines

The standard way to write for the components in your design system. These take platform conventions and best practices for writing all into consideration.
